Q1: $('#footer').toggle(todoCount > 0).html(template);
    why can you call ".html(template)" if todoCount > 0 is true?

Answer: 
oooh in response to my question yesterday about what the toggle method in jQuery returns..

after taking the advice to use the debugger, i got a whole new understanding of it!! realized it returns a jQuery object and then you call the .html property to replace inner html with the new html. (line 85 of todoMVC)

the new html is the template variable declared on line 78. ooh also, discovered how to see what is the return type on the jQuery docs HAHA.



Q2: Pretty sure I'm correct because I'm sickkk but, 
    $('#toggle-all').prop('checked', this.getActiveTodos().length === 0);
    does this means that the toggle all button will be checked if there are no active todos?
    ie all the todos are completed.
    Second argument is the value to set for the property. 

Q3: Definitely need to understand jQuery event object more indepth. line 60. 
    Edit: Look into .on method line 66. Understand the second argument.
