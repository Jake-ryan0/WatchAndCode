Q1: $('#footer').toggle(todoCount > 0).html(template);
    why can you call ".html(template)" if todoCount > 0 is true?

Q2: Pretty sure I'm correct because I'm sickkk but, 
    $('#toggle-all').prop('checked', this.getActiveTodos().length === 0);
    does this means that the toggle all button will be checked if there are no active todos?
    ie all the todos are completed.

Q3: 

line 205 onwards. trim and .data("abort")
Definitely need to understand jQuery evenrt object more indepth. line 60.
